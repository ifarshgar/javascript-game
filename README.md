## Instructions for memory game 

This is a card game where pairs of cards contain images, such that for each card, there is exactly one other card with the same image. The cards are placed face-down on a surface. A player chooses any two cards and flips them face-up. If they happen to have the same image, they will stay face-up — otherwise, they should be flipped back. This continues until all cards are face-up.
